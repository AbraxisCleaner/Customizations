# Customizations
A small amount of customizations to various programs I use.

# 4coder Themes
If I use 4coder in the future and decide to make more themes, I'll add them here. For now, I only made the one and have now switched away from 4coder.

# DWM
When I was using linux, DWM was my window manager of choice. I made some extremely basic customizations to it, and don't want to have to go through the trouble of setting it up again in the future.

# FireFox
If I make more adjustments to FireFox I'll add subfolders, but right now I only use the one modification and it's just to add trapezoidal tabs.
